RICK AND MORTY SNAKE GAME:

I love the Rick and Morty animation show, and I thought why not use it as a theme for my game.
Eventually I will have the snake head be Rick, and the food piece be morty.

This game was developed using HTML, CSS, & Javascript only.

I used CSS grid to showcase the gameboard part of the game.


Rules:

Use Arrow Keys up, down, left, and right to move the snake.
Eat as many food pieces without going outside the grid or running into itself.



I have a friend that is further along than I am, in a coding bootcamp through FlatIron Schools and has completed freecodecamps HTML, CSS, & Javascript courses. He helped me with some parts of the game and is referenced below as well as my comments do state where he helped me in the code.
